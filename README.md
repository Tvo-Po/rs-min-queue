# Queue with minimum

Implemention of the queue that can also tell what the current minimum is. **The implementation have at least amortized O(1) complexity for all calls.**

## Notes:

- Base algorithm is described at [cp-algorithms](https://cp-algorithms.com/data_structures/stack_queue_modification.html);
- Instead of two stacks [VecDeque](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.VecDeque.html) has been used to solve this problem.
